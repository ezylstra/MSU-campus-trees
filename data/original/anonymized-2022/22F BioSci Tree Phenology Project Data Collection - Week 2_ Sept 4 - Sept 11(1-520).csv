I was assigned two trees that I found and have taken a picture of to track the progress of the trees. One tree is Metasequioa glypostrobodies which is. the dawn-redwood tree Id number is 20060244*12. My other tree was an Ulmus amercana Amrican elm tree with the id number of CC6446*02. However, when it came time to submit my forum for this particular tree the information for it wasn't coming up. I spoke to Seth Hunt and he said to write in the comments on this post so I can get my full credit and I have submitted my first form on time as well so I wont get late penalty marks."
